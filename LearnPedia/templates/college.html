            Requirements
            <div class="boxtext">
                Each school has an application fee (75 or 80$)
                Each school has a certain amount of teacher evaluations required.
                The mid-year report is a report that your councilor (aka mentor) has to write in the middle of your senior (12th) year.
                Some schools require an SAT without an essay, and some require English proficiency tests. It seems that lots of schools have different exam requirements, so see each case for yourself.
                The schools that require the SATâ€™s, have an average registration fee of 50$
                Schools have different application dates but the final application date is typically sometime right after the new year.
                Some schools also require portfolios, made with slide room.
                The grand majority of schools on the common app require the common app essay, an essay that can be written about essentially anything you want, with a few prompts that are to be helpful to the applicant.
